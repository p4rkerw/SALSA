**Welcome to üå∂Ô∏èSALSA! Single Cell Allele Specific Analysis**

Follow along with one of the tutorials.

*Single Cell Gene Expression:*
1) Genotype, phase and generate allele-specific read counts for chromosome 22 using a 10X Genomics single cell gene expression dataset obtained from a peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc). Check out the [tutorial](https://github.com/p4rkerw/SALSA/tree/main/Tutorials/single_cell_gex).

*Single Cell ATAC*
2) Genotype, phase and generate allele-specific read counts for chromosome 22 using a 10X Genomics single cell ATAC dataset obtained from a peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc). Check out the [tutorial](https://github.com/p4rkerw/SALSA/tree/main/Tutorials/single_cell_atac).
