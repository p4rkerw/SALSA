**Welcome to üå∂Ô∏èSALSA! Single Cell Allele Specific Analysis**


Follow along with one of the tutorials:

*Single Cell Gene Expression:* </br>
- Genotype, phase and generate allele-specific read counts for chromosome 22 using a 10X Genomics single cell gene expression dataset obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) in a healthy donor. Check out the [tutorial](https://github.com/p4rkerw/SALSA/tree/main/Tutorials/single_cell_gex).

*Single Cell ATAC:* </br>
- Genotype, phase and generate allele-specific read counts for chromosome 22 using a 10X Genomics single cell ATAC dataset obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) in a healthy donor. Check out the [tutorial](https://github.com/p4rkerw/SALSA/tree/main/Tutorials/single_cell_atac).
